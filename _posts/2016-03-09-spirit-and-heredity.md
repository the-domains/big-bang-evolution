## Evolution by selection, intelligent design and creation are delicate subjects.

There are countries where you have to 
deal very careful about these issues.These issues delivers sharp 
discussions with different religious groups.Evolution by the Spirit is 
based on a universal spiritual starting point of view. 

, in which the Spirit manifest as

of all the matter and so delivers structure, memory and 

for the future and further evolution.These ideas are 

than the ideas of Darwin (natural selection /survival of the fittest) + intelligent design + creation by Great creator (God). 

See and in the book.

**Note**: is
the pseudo scientific view that certain features of the universe and of
living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an 
undirected process such as natural selection. Educators, philosophers, 
and the scientific community have demonstrated that ID is a religious 
argument, a form of creationism which lacks empirical support and offers
no tenable hypotheses.Proponents argue that it is an evidence-based 
scientific theory about life's origins that challenges the 
methodological naturalism inherent in modern science, while conceding 
that they have yet to produce a fully worked-out scientific theory. The 
leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute, a 
politically conservative think tank based in the United States. Although
they state that ID is not creationism and deliberately avoid assigning a
personality to the designer, many of these proponents express belief 
that the designer is the Christian deity.

# Spirit and heredity

Apart from hereditary gene structures and DNA spirals, 

the spirit, as a carrier of information,
is a mechanism controlling organic life. Little by little DNA secrets 
and chromosome structures are unravelled and described. The creation of 
life through generic and sexless reproduction is a fascinating event. In
a strictly ordered fashion the conjugation of tiny differentiated cells
creates a beautiful, new and complete life. Each group of cells grows 
into a specialist cell structure of tissue or organs, according to a 
structured plan of development. In its first stages, the human embryo is
very similar to other forms of animal life. Their mutual origins are 
clearly present. Cells differentiate and specialise rapidly.

This process of biochemical interaction between hereditary material 
and cell division is controlled by a great cooperative complex. Commands
are given and executed with a high degree of precision. 

This
process can well be called a logistic miracle. A brilliant time 
schedule in addition to a high level of predictability of the end 
result. Memory plays a crucial part too.

Chromosomes carry 
hereditary information. As the saying goes: history repeats itself. 
History is stored and passed on. It is hard to imagine that a few 
specific combinations of amino acids and bases can instigate and control
such a complex history of reproduction. The elementary DNA material 
forms the biochemical key to the production of related proteins that 
react to become chains of amino acids and other organic matter. 

The
dimensionless spirit wanders around this matter, governing the process 
of life with its imaginary sequence of numbers full of memory. Like an 
all-encompassing cocoon it communicates with matter.

Processes of reproduction are not unique, they happen all the time in
different places at different times as well as simultaneously. The 
uniformity of the process is biochemically controlled by genetic 
material and by number sequences that recorded the values of energies 
and reactions in memory keys. The memory key with number sequences acts 
like a catalyst for the development of the process. The correct value 
for the correct dosage prompt a reaction. 

These
correct values are obtained through a continuous and intelligent 
learning process by the spirit. What is the most balanced step in the 
process that renders the best continuation? The selection and permanent 
adjustment of memory values ensure an organism can develop.

Memory is not formed by fixed number sequences with keys starting and
controlling processes. Because of its internal contrast between matter 
and antimatter,

the spirit is motivated to
improve nature's ordering processes in a forward direction. Any 
mutation that appears to be an improvement is advantageous

to the
organism involved. It is passed on through procreation and cell 
division. When success and progress are repeated, these new genetic 
codes and their values from the imaginary number sequences are etched in
the memory and thus recorded in the genetic codes and morphological 
fields of the imaginary number sequences. 

The
more successfully these codes are repeated, the more prominent and 
dominant the new genetic code and its corresponding morphological field 
will be.

Consequently, the genetic and spiritual morphological components enhance and complement each other in evolutionary terms.

The learning process of consciousness also follows the etching of information and number values

.
Repeating actions lies at the core of all elementary learning 
processes. This applies both to motoric and sensory models of action and
reaction. Insight and analysis take place at a higher spiritual level. 
However, both learn from mistakes.

Language learning takes up a special place within this learning 
process. Apart from having conversations about various subjects to 
increase one's verbal command of a language, learning how to read is 
essential to structure communication. In addition to a grasp of grammar,
sentence construction and parsing, being skilful in reading is a 
prerequisite for writing clear and well-structured texts. Bit by bit 
words are learnt and reproduced by babies. Sentences become increasingly
more complex. At school language proficiency is stimulated with further
vocabulary, speaking and writing skills. 

Words are meaning-carrying symbols, that serve to communicate and exchange information with one's environment.

The phenomenon of heredity carries the history of organic life. The 
heredity principle and genetic material are identical for the greater 
part of organic life. Differences in genetic material account for a mere
few percentages. Yet, from this mutual base sprang a very diverse 
palette of life forms. The life processes of cells and organisms also 
show many correspondences. Life processes are driven by genetic messages
and biochemical interactions as well as by cell structures which turn 
processes on and off, slow them down or accelerate them.

A cell structure is complex, because it is minute, but still 
represents many functions and actions. It supplies energy, composes and 
decomposes matter, reproduces external information and responds to it. 
These compact and specialised complexes share a mutual and universal 
cell structure, but yet perform strictly different functions. They are 
differently controlled genetically and have different active locations 
in their gene sequence. Somehow the non-active locations in the gene 
sequence are kept inactive. Either they are restricted by the 
compactness of the cell mass or an imaginary number sequence blocks 
their activity by means of a key that perfectly fits their genetic code.

Continuous repetitions of this process record the number key that 
guarantees a reliable and dependable process with the proper logistics 
and dosage. The evolution of one-celled organisms into the complex 
creatures we see today is a wonderfully complex process, considering the
factors that were vitally important to get them developed. Not only on a
micro level, but on a macro level as well. 

Atmospheric
conditions, regulated temperatures and feedback mechanisms all provide a
stable environment for an organism to grow in.

The concentrations of oxygen, hydrogen and carbon need to be exactly 
right. When concentrations vary, the mechanisms try to find an 
equilibrium to restore the optimum values. 

These macro factors are vitally important for stable organic structures and life forms to develop.

They cannot be considered as chance factors, considering their complex urge to establish an equilibrium. 

They
are internally motivated by the trinity of matter -- spirit -- antimatter
that implies progress after a battle for improvement.

This fundamental trinity forms the basis for the creation of the 
universe and all organic life. This symmetry mirrors the spirit checking
the deathly urge of matter and antimatter to destroy each other. Like a
cocoon it encompasses all matter. By doing so it bridges the 
differences between matter and antimatter in order for stable structures
of matter to develop. 

The tensions between matter and antimatter are neutralised by the spirit to a large extent

. The remainder potential supplies the energy to grow, causing progress and the phenomena of time and history. 

The
spirit stores its history in memory number sequences by means of 
elementary laws of physics and the natural rules and constants

resulting from it. Internally motivated, the mass of matter becomes ever more differentiated and specialised.

Without any differences in potential, the urge for organisation and 
structuring would be lacking and, consequently, the evolution would run a
completely arbitrary course or would even come to a halt. 

The
parameters for the development of organic and intelligent forms of life
were recorded at an early stage. Cosmic constants and laws are there in
order to instigate organic life eventually.

Where does this deep
wisdom, that brings about organic and intelligent forms of life through
evolution, come from? It is the strong urge of matter 

to neutralise the potential between matter -- spirit -- antimatter so that perfect harmony and mirror symmetry can be achieved.

The only way in which this can be obtained is through spiritual enrichment instead of material enrichment. 

The classic contrast between matter -- spirit -- antimatter can only be overcome by spiritual and intellectual progress.

This provides the wisdom that striving for material satisfaction of 
one's own interests at the cost of other fellow human beings is wrong 
and causes destruction, violence, poverty and oppression.

The history of humanity clearly slows that this notion has not broken
through yet. In recent history, humanity has used intellectual progress
to obtain material gains and to realise self-interests politically 
through the exclusion of large groups of people, animals and plants. 
Like a predator, humanity today is stripping away the treasures of 
nature and hurting its fellow living creatures. Fellow human beings, 
animals and plants deserve space to live on earth.

The economic model of capitalism provided material growth at the cost
of other living creatures by focussing fundamentally on economic 
self-interest. Capitalist market control institutionalises the hunger 
for money, pleasure and power and in many ways it has been a successful 
control mechanism socially. It has clearly increased material growth and
wealth for large groups of people. However, the more successful it is, 
the more harmful to man's natural environment it becomes.

# Spirit and evolution

Darwin was a pioneer in trying to understand the direction of 
development and growth of complexity. The part played by hereditary 
mutations and advantages of selection offered humanity a great deal of 
insight. Today's knowledge of gene structures clarifies that the number 
of genes per species does not constitute evolutionary success. Nor does 
control of gene pairs.

The differences between gene pairs of 
higher and lower forms of life are surprisingly small. The true factors 
contributing to evolutionary success lie in the possibilities of 
expression and copying. The essential difference in successful 
regulation and instigation of evolution is made by the spirit factor 
acting as a cocoon of memory.

It houses the past, present (real) and future (virtual). A species or
a specific organ in its embryonic stages is developed through virtual 
archetypes that are repetitively produced.

Like a building plan the organic growth of an embryo can be laid over 
virtual archetypes. The spirit's drive for progress stimulates an 
ever-increasing perfection of life processes.

History repeats itself ever- increasingly into the archetype. The future has now also been enclosed into the spirit. 

As a cocoon of memory for matter and life processes, the spirit is internally programmed to achieve progress.

Consequently, the future and the desired development results are also 
ingrained in the spirit. The spirit compares the desired future 
evolutionary progress with genes. Both desired and undesired mutations 
in genes and DNA strands are expressed by degeneration and innovation 
that suit a species' future archetypes.

The chance of positive mutations and repetitions of successful 
behaviour is increased by the spirit's capacity for memory and learning.
It is expressed by virtual and gene codes. When mutations of successful
reproductions or successful behaviour are repeated, they are ingrained 
and established in the spirit's memory. 

The
spirit factor houses the past, present (real) and future (virtual) so 
it can control life processes and development progress like a leitmotif.

A familiar

critique on the classic theory of evolution

,
i.e. that primary organic matter develops into complicated organs and 
forms of life, is that mutations and selections are too rough an 
instrument to be able to render refined co-operations, specialisation 
and forms of consciousness. 

The transition
of one-celled bacteria to thinking mammals is too unlikely when 
mutations and natural selection are the only sources of creation.

The spirit factor, however, offers the drive and instruments that can 
create complex, organic and conscious forms of life. The number of gene 
pairs is different with simple and complicated forms of life, but not to
such an extent as their degree of complexity would one lead to expect. 
It is not the number of gene pairs, but the way in which gene pairs are 
controlled that constitutes the difference between man and ape.

In genetic terms the difference is 
only 1%, while the development of the embryo in most species is similar --
it is mainly the end result that is fixed.

This universal 
process of embryonic development has been ingrained in the development 
of archetypes through history and repetition. 

An unlikely small genetic variation

will cause a highly specific, species-bound embryonic development.

The spirit factor drives the small genetic differences that will yield a specific species.

From its first cell, the embryonic cell division process moves toward the fixed end 

result of a total archetype or hologram.

This virtual image functions as a point of departure to drive the 
embryonic cell division process as to task ability and place 
orientation. Life forms that are driven by the spirit carry a refinement
in complexity and a reward for successful behaviour. Mutations can 
either speed up or confuse this process.

The virtual total archetype always tends to look for improvement and progress in the future.

Mutations and successful learning behaviour can accelerate the process by leaps.

There is an inherent drive to develop complexity and order. The spirit 
factor embodies the ingrained past, the present and the future as 
important shaping elements.
