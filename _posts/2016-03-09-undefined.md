Introduction of
the most important chapters of the book with convincing and proved 
evidence and the reinterpretation of the famous: E = m\*c

The big bang is the most important idea in cosmology now a days. According to experts, nothing is known about 

.
There were no natural laws and nothing like time, light, and space had 
yet emerged in the original singularity. A fraction after the big bang, 
physical agents came into being, as well as the factors of time, light 
and space in a gigantic hot energy sea. Temperatures quickly began to 
drop. The energy sea was then able to 'freeze' or condense to form 
matter. The above-mentioned natural laws were 

in the original singularity, albeit unable to manifest themselves without time, light, and space.

The world and the universe are not created by God.The Spirit is the motor of the big bang and evolution of matter and live.

This is a total new approach of 
creation of live ,evolution and conscious,A more spiritual and meta 
physical approach, but the theory is 

based and based on empirically evidence by 

about volume of dark matter and dark energy in addition to levels of hydrogen and helium. Interested? Read

**Fundamental numerical proportions before, during, and after the Big Bang **

The big bang is considered to be the very start of the universe. 
According to experts, nothing is known about the pre-big bang period. 
There were no natural laws and nothing like time, light, and space had 
yet emerged in the original singularity. A fraction after the big bang, 
physical agents came into being, as well as the factors of time, light 
and space in a gigantic hot energy sea. Temperatures quickly began to 
drop. The energy sea was then able to 'freeze' or condense to form 
matter. The above-mentioned natural laws were already existent in the 
original singularity, albeit unable to manifest themselves without time,
light, and space.

The big bang, in my opinion, does not mark the absolute beginning of 
the universe. There were several explosions that -- in the absence of the
correct mix of physical agents and constants -- imploded once more, 
richer by a learning experience.

The pre-big bang situation represented a super symmetric numerical proportion of 

/

matter, 

/

spirit/memory, and 

/

antimatter, in which the spirit factor, as a cocoon of all matter and antimatter, kept up the equilibrium of the balance.

This is a precarious balance with an unbelievable amount of energy 
occupying an infinitesimally small space. In this incredibly small, 
high-energy environment, the wave-particles respectively the time-space 
continuum is permanent, without any static state. Any quantum 
fluctuation that is not adequately neutralized by the spirit factor 
serves as an initiator of the next big bang. This quantum fluctuation is
a result of a conscious memory entity that causes the wave-particle 
duality to collapse outside the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, since 
the space is infinitesimally small.

The spirit factor as a cocoon keeps the whole from bursting apart.

This conscious memory entity is 
part of the spirit as a learning and evolutionary motor in the context 
of the creation of a sustainable universe that has become sufficiently 
evolved and balanced so as to avoid the implosion that would ordinarily 
follow. After several cosmic explosions and learning moments, the spirit
factor was balanced enough to cause the big bang 15 billion years ago. 
In the case of a big bang, an inconceivable amount of energy is released
into space. If the mix of universal physical constants and physical 
agents is not sufficiently balanced, an implosion will follow. All 
matter, antimatter, and energy implodes again to its original 
singularity, once more with a 

super symmetry of 

/

matter, 

/

spirit, and 

/

antimatter.

All waste products are reunited 
again in an infinitesimally small space, in which the original symmetry 
is recreated by unimaginably high pressure and heat. The definitive and 
sufficiently balanced big bang that occurred 15 billion years ago was 
not accompanied by an implosion. In the case of the fatal quantum 
fluctuation, the original singularity exploded.

When disrupting the super 
symmetry, matter gained the upper hand over antimatter and the spirit 
factor was sufficiently evolved to allow sustainable development with 
the correct mix and adjustment of universal physical constants and 
physical agents. Owing to the slight prevalence of matter over 
antimatter, an incredibly large amount of matter was destroyed and 
turned into degenerated dark matter, which accounts for the lion share 
of all matter and is part of the matter in the universe.

The slight prevalence of matter over antimatter

(1% of 1%

)
is the primary component (the heavier, more complex molecules) of 
evolution. Energy and mass distribution yields one of the bizarre 
numerical proportions that 'evidently' entail completely illogical trash
piles that -- due to the 'dark' character -- are difficult to discern and
trace. Only 1% of all matter can be verifiably analyzed. Besides, this 
one percent also consists of 24% helium, 75% hydrogen and only 1% 
heavier, more complex molecules. 

The remaining 99% are attributed to 33,33 % cosmological constant

(a mysterious repulsive anti-gravity -- antimatter-oriented factor

)
and 33,33% dark matter -- including 24% with non baryonic -- waste of 
leptons, W and Z bosons, and photons (waste products of matter 
controlled by weak nuclear energy, electromagnetic forces, and 
degenerated matter). The remaining 8% are a waste product of dark 
baryonic matter and, as such, a waste product of strong nuclear energy 
with degenerated quarks, hadrons, and mesons.

Yet, entering the evidently bizarre matter and energy trash piles into the famous Einstein equation E = MC2 places them in a logical relationship**(see diagram)**.
In my reinterpretation, Einstein's energy = mass equivalent, with the 
square speed of light as a correction factor, covers a much wider 
spectrum **(see diagram**).

In the context of super symmetry, the pre-big bang numerical proportions of 1/3 matter, 1/3 spirit, and 1/3 antimatter are reflected by the equation E = MC2; energy (100%) = mass 1/3 + C2 (2/3). The energy 3/3 is represented by the 4 known physical agents (**see diagram**). The mass 1/3 by the known mass respectively matter (visible and dark matter). C2 represents 2/3, in which 1/3 are anti-gravity  and 1/3 antimatter remnant. 

The original pre-big bang cosmic ratio of 3x 

/

is thus reflected in the original equation E = MC

(

.

The 1/3 matter is expressed in terms of particles (micro) and space (macro). The 1/3 spirit is expressed as a cocoon of all matter (micro) and as light irradiating all discernable matter (macro). The 1/3
antimatter is expressed as a wave function (micro) and time (history, 
memory) are expressed as macro expressions. The perfect trinity in the 
context of super symmetry dovetails with itself by the wave-particle 
duality (quantum mechanics) and the space-time continuum in accordance 
with relativity theory. The manifestation of perfect trinity culminates 
in the original cosmic equation E = MC2 (**see diagram**).

There is an elusive relation connecting
quantum mechanics and relativity. Matter is frozen energy and manifests
itself as particle in space. The spirit is a memory, heredity, and 
consciousness carrier of visual spiritual matter on a micro level; while
the macro level is expressed by light,

which may be a particle as well as a wave, despite the fact that light has no mass.

This is a contradiction in terms; light is a wave as well as a 
particle and without mass, virtually and actually detectable. Thus, 
spirit respectively light bridges the gap of the wave-particle duality 
in quantum mechanics and the space-time continuum / the curvature 
according to relativity theory.

The two inconceivable worlds of 1/3 matter and 1/3
antimatter may coexist through the spirit factor. There is no matter 
without energy. Without matter there is no space without spirit, no big 
bang, no evolution, and no long-term coexistence of matter and 
antimatter. Without light there is no discernable universe. Without 
antimatter there is no super symmetry. Without waves there is no duality
and no energy flow. Without time there is no history, now or in the 
future, and no evolution.

All of these original cosmic components are interrelated and 
intertwined like a kind of Holy Trinity, which is fundamental to all 
life in our universe. 

The numerical proportions found in super symmetry and E = MC

(

) also pertain to time measurement (

/

, 

/

part
etc.) and a light speed of C2 equals approximately 3\. It is not 
surprising, therefore, that organic conscious life forms have developed 
here on our planet with its 24-hour days.

The numeric's of our time on Earth (

/

/

/

) also pertain to the standard model of matter, with 6 types of quarks and 6 types of leptons. 

This is no coincidence but arises from the numerical proportions found in cosmic symmetry and E = MC

**Chapter 36**

**Correlation between physical agents -- energy -- mass -- spirit**

The E = MC

equation is also reflected by the energy/force distribution

. Gravity (

/

of the energy) externally influences matter through gravitons (mass 
less), which is expressed as space. Gravity is the macro designer of the
universe and emerged as the first physical agent after the big bang. 
Gravity influences the positive charge of matter. The strong nuclear 
energy (

/

of the energy) affects the atomic 
nuclei and the heavier elementary baryonic particles. This energy has a 
considerable power across very small distances.

During the big bang, the strong nuclear energy emerged from the 
antimatter part as the second physical agent. The very strong attractive
forces in a very small space (atomic nuclei) can only give rise to 
stable molecular nuclei if enough repulsive energy is left to prevent 
the collapse of these atomic nuclei. The repulsive function of 
anti-gravity and the spirit/cocoon buffer create stable atomic nuclei 
with a strong bond. The force-carrying gluons are mass less and manifest
themselves as waves.

The baryonic elementary particles have a relatively large amount of mass/energy. 

The
numbers and proportions of 6 particles -- 6 antiparticles reflect the 
exact same numerical proportions as our time measurement in hours and 
days. 

.

The weak nuclear energy also has a background in the antimatter part (1/6 share
of the energy). It is an exception in the context of the four physical 
agents. It is the only physical agent to act inside as well as outside 
the atomic nucleus. Its energy is focused on leptons (almost mass less 
elementary particles such as neutrinos, muons, and electrons). These 
particles are almost massless/energyless and therefore difficult to 
bind.

The force-carrying bosons W-W+Wo -- being the only force 
carriers -- are very much inoperative and this is remarkable. They are so
very inoperative in order to generate a force to act on the almost mass
less leptons.

The weak nuclear energy is the only force outside the P and T 
symmetry and this is equally astonishing. The weak nuclear energy is an 
exception in the context of the four physical agents and also with 
regard to the super symmetry of 1/3 matter, 1/3 spirit, and 1/3 antimatter.
The weak nuclear energy is an exception due to the disruption of the 
symmetry and multiple-force expression (inside/outside the atomic 
nucleus) and, as such, a catalyst for the big bang.

The big bang started by quantum fluctuation in 

super symmetry (

/

/

/

)

so that the fixed stable numerical proportion of 

/

/

/

became
unbalanced and exploded. During previous big bangs, the mass and the 
stored energy had once more imploded because the cosmic constants were 
not yet sufficiently fine-tuned and balanced to prevent implosion and to
restore super symmetry.

During the last big bang, however, 

the universal physical constants were fine-tuned and sufficiently balanced

;
and the weak nuclear energy -- due to symmetry disruption -- was too 
strong a catalyst to cause the big bang to implode once more to restore 
super symmetry. The spirit factor as a cocoon of super symmetry; and all
matter and antimatter is totally enveloped by it.

Both an internal and an external cocoon.

The spirit factor is a consciousness carrier (identity carrier)

and acts as a trigger to cause a big bang by matter-antimatter quantum 
fluctuation. The spirit factor is an evolution / growth consciousness 
containing in itself a progressive force, besides the harmony of super 
symmetry (

/

/

/

).
In the context of this dilemma, various big bangs followed upon each 
other and imploded up until the last one, 14 million years ago, when it 
turned out that

all natural constants were
just sufficiently fine-tuned to prevent implosion and to evolve and 
give rise to a universe with wonderful nature, but also with a bizarre 
macro matter distribution (visible/dark matter).

The electromagnetic force, together with weak nuclear energy, was the last to emerge from the big bang. It originated from the 1/3 spirit
factor in conjunction with super symmetry. The electromagnetic force is
the (virtual) materialization of the spirit factor. The intermediary 
between wave and particle duality and the space-time continuum by wave 
of light and photons (real and virtual). In a chemical sense, the 
electromagnetic force is the identity carrier of the molecules 
(composed). At the smallest elementary level, the spirit is the identity
carrier and cocoon.

On a somewhat 'larger' level, the electrons are shells enveloping the
atomic nucleus. Through electromagnetic interaction, they allow the 
molecular bonding of atoms and thus the evolvement of matter. The 
electromagnetic force is carried by almost mass less electrons that -- 
through photons -- allow (real) virtual interaction/communication with 
external molecules.

**On a micro/quantum level**, 

light acts as a virtual bridge between the wave-particle duality; while

; 

light
bridges the gap between time and space. On a micro scale, the 
wave-particle duality plays the same role that the time-space continuum 
plays on a macro level

. The light both particle and wave, mass as mass less, real as virtual is the intermediary in

the framework of quantum wave-particle duality and the time-space continuum. 

In which context antimatter -- the carrier of weak and strong nuclear 
energy -- is expressed as a wave and the wave is expressed as time. The 
spirit factor (the carrier of electromagnetic forces), in turn, is 
expressed by the virtual spirit cocoon as an identity and a memory 
carrier on a 'micro' level and on a 'macro quantum' level by virtual 
light. 

This can bridge the gap between 
wave and particle duality. On a 'real' level, electromagnetic light acts
as a bridge between time-space in the four dimensions of the universe.

The spirit factor in super symmetry equals 

/

and this numerical proportion is also reflected by the energy/force distribution of 

/

of a total of four physical agents.

**Chapter 37**

**Correlation of big bang -- macro matter/energy and micro matter/energy distribution**

The macro matter/energy distribution (**see diagram**) reveals the cosmic/super symmetry of 1/3 matter, 1/3 spirit, and 1/3 antimatter, and the sequel of the big bang with 1/3 gravity, 1/3 electromagnetic forces, and 1/6 weak nuclear energy and 1/6 strong nuclear energy (raw material the antimatter). The big bang caused a large amount of energy and matter to degenerate.

The inconceivably large and disproportionately sloppy matter and 
energy distribution gives rise to an evidently bizarre and demented 
universe that merely raises more questions. The reinterpretation of E = 
MC2 with numerical proportions of 1/3 1/3 1/3, however, gives rise to an understandable energy and matter distribution **(see diagram**).

The macro matter distribution E (3/3) = M 1/3 C2 (2/3) affords a sensible C2 of 66,66%: 1/3 anti-gravity energy and 1/3 remnants antimatter. The M of mass 1/3 affords 1/12 8.33
% baric dark matter as a remnant of strong nuclear energy. The 
non-baric dark matter (8 %) consists of remnants of weak nuclear energy (1/6) -1/12 levorotatory
leptons and levorotatory quarks. The dextrorotatory leptons and quarks 
are not exposed to any weak nuclear energy. The spin direction 
determines the force distribution in the atomic nuclei. The fact that 
dextrorotatory leptons and quarks do not experience any weak nuclear 
energy is

a violation of P and T symmetry

.

The remaining electromagnetic force 1/3 -1/6 non-baryonic
dark matter (16.00%). Together this affords 24 % + 1 % visible matter 
(due to fragmentation / big bang super symmetry). The macro energy and 
matter distribution under M is somewhat less than 1/3 due
to super symmetry failure. The 1% useful and evolvable matter is 
divided once more into mirror-symmetric numerical proportions of 75% 
hydrogen (66.66% + 8.33 baric dark matter) and 24% Helium (mirroring 24%
non-baric dark matter) and the remaining 1% heavier, more complex 
matter.

The centre of gravity in the macro proportions of matter -- energy -- 
antimatter is at C2 (dark anti-gravity energy and remnants of antimatter
(66.66%) and the large amount of dark matter under M (32.33%). 

Together, they account for 99% of the entire universe.

There was an evidently bizarre and demented waste of energy and matter during the big bang.

**The micro mass proportions on an atomic level** (1% of
the entire energy and matter) show the same evidently bizarre mass 
differences on an elementary quarks and leptons level. The 1/12 and1/6 

numerical
proportions are reflected in the numbers of leptons and quarks (6-6 of 
12-12, particle -- antiparticle) and in the time system of hours, 
quarters,

etc.

The pairs of quarks -- up -- down, charm -- strange, top -- bottom -- 
reveal disproportionately large mass differences; which is also true of 
the leptons group (6-6). The third generation (from impact testing) 
remains by far the greatest challenge and the most difficult to detect.

In this case, too, the numerical mass 
proportions equal 99-1%. A mirror symmetry of 100% macro 99-1 to micro 
1% 99-1%. The universe as a whole is evidently bizarre in its matter and
energy distribution, in much the same way as the micro world, on an 
atomic level, is bizarre in its mass and energy distribution. 
Considering pre-big bang proportions (3x

/

) and E = MC2, however, they may be converted to understandable units, despite the bizarre numeric's.
