## An introduction about a total new way of thinking and doing.

**The world according to the Spirit**

aims
to unite the spirit with the material and physical world of science and
cosmology. The central theme lies in the trinity of matter -- spirit -- 
antimatter being the original start of the universe. Questions asked 
this website are answered in the book. 

How are the different cosmic constants related?

Trying to find a unique unification theory?

What is the relation between space-time -- spirit ?

Relation between the distribution of micro and macro matter throughout the universe?

What is the reason for the Big Bang?

Curious about the relation between spirit and matter?

Searching for the meaning of life?

This book contains 

on
politics, religion, science, physics, medicine, quantum mechanics, 
philosophy, meta physics, aesthetics, evolution, the meaning of life and
much more (

).

**The world according to the spirit**

offers
new and original answers to various aspects of life and thought. It 
aims to renew human thought and behavior and to offer solutions to the 
significant problems faced by humanity and the environment on earth.

About me ; R.M. Bakker: research 1980 -- 2010 : a pragmatic spiritual well-read autodidact and generalist

# Preface new book; The world according to the spirit

30 Years of self-tuition, involving much reading and practical and 
deep thinking as an autodidact. I have had an urge to develop these 
ideas since I was a child. My mind urged me to try and understand the 
world and science and their relation. It seemed to be a mission 
impossible,**this search for the true source of life and origins of consciousness in a bizarre and strange universe.** Soon, in my mind I had already formed**the principle of the trinity of matter -- spirit -- antimatter. To me it 
was extremely intriguing that the big bang originated from a singularity
that lacked any order or natural law.** It was simply said that 
nothing could be known about the composition of the singularity; order 
only came into existence after the big bang. I have always thought it 
highly unsatisfactory and strange that issues like matter -- antimatter 
and the four main powers of gravity, weak and strong nuclear energy and 
electromagnetic force came into being within a fraction of a second in a
physical constellation which had to be perfect from the word go. If it 
had not been, the unbalanced mix of cosmic constants would have 
condemned the big bang to a certain collapse. 

This
assumption of a perfectly balanced mix of cosmic constants comes from 
the idea of a perfectly wise creator who had been dealt a lucky hand of 
the proper ingredients. Strangest of all is the fact that matter and 
antimatter must have co-existed in the singularity, in an extremely 
small space without destroying each other. Something must have added 
stability to the singularity to prevent premature collapse. This 
assumption formed the basis to develop the principle of the trinity: 
matter -- spirit -- antimatter.

Empiricism and reductionism in science have contributed much useful 
knowledge and progress to humanity and civilisation. However, it is a 
persistent problem that despite this huge scientific progress, essential
existential questions and religious needs of humanity remained 
unanswered. Until today, religions are prominently present in the world,
influencing politics and ethics.

It cost me a great deal of time and effort to write this book, The 
world according to the spirit. It took me at least 30 years of my life 
to search for answers to my questions. Writing a book forces you to be 
logically consistent and to explain your train of thought and 
development of ideas fittingly. To write a chapter of an elaborate book 
like this requires an enormous mental concentration and peace of mind as
well as the command of a good deal of background knowledge. I have 
followed scientific news and have read many books to take my knowledge 
to a higher level. I am a generalist and an autodidact, who has been 
inspired by the ideas of the Enlightenment. The era of enlightenment 
gave us freedom and equality of citizens and the Trias Politica, being 
the separation of legislative, executive and judiciary powers, as well 
as the separation of church and state. The era of enlightenment gave us 
Uomo Universalis and the possibility to increase knowledge and skills 
through empiricism and spiritual and intellectual enrichment.

In the last decade my knowledge had reached a satisfactory and high enough level to meet the final challenge: **relating
the concept of the trinity of matter -- spirit -- antimatter to the 
latest scientific theories of quantum mechanics, relativity and 
cosmology.** Encouraged by my wife, I actually started to write 
this book. I was busy doing other things. I knew I would only be taken 
seriously if I could develop a credible theory of unification. It was 
hard labour, but I am proud of the result, including the role played by 
the spirit.

This book could cause quite a stir in the world. It is a good time for humanity to seek new ways. **The world according to the spirit** offers tools to improve human theories and behaviour in lots of different areas.

The Spirit and Human Consciousness          chapter 27

The Spirit is everywhere around the 
world and universe.That's why matter has the possibility to organize 
it's self and his environment.That's why the human consciousness is able
to understand and to communicate whit the world around and to built up a
huge and impressive memory.

The Spirit and Human Thinking, Creativity and Free Will   chapter 28

The world around us has a spiritual as 
well as a material dimension. They overlap where the memory cocoon of 
the spirit provides matter with structure and identity. How then can a 
person be distinguished according to their own personality, considering 
this starting point ? Mister X has a different attitude to reality than 
Mrs Y, although the objective reality is the same to them both. But 
everyone has a different personal explanation for this reality.Everyone 
has a different character and temperament to deal with opportunity's and
threats of live.These elements have a background in the collective sub 
conscious.

Relation -- Antimatter -- Wave -- Time    chapter 33

Antimatter was largely destroyed by the big bang. A memory of the super symmetry (3 \* 1/3) is what remained within the c

(2 \* 1/3), namely the spirit/light factor -- an all-encompassing cocoon of virtual memory and identity

The antimatter that remained contains anti gravity, opposed to the gravity we are familiar with. This ensures that the universe 

force, but expands by the repelling force of anti gravity (half of 2/3 and c

).

Anti gravity controls time in

,
as we know it: time is future-oriented. The laws of entropy, however, 
predict increasing chaos and disorder as time passes. If there were no 
counter force, the big bang and fracture of symmetry would have caused 
the original singularity to dissolve into chaos and disorder.Both 
antimatter and time are highly intriguing subjects.
