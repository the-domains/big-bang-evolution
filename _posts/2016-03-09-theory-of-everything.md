# Theory of everything

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A **theory of everything** (**ToE**) or **final theory**, **ultimate theory**, or **master theory** is a hypothetical single, all-encompassing, coherent [theoretical framework of physics][0] that fully explains and links together all physical aspects of the [universe][1].

[\[][2]

Finding a ToE is one of the major 

.
Over the past few centuries, two theoretical frameworks have been 
developed that, as a whole, most closely resemble a ToE. These two 
theories upon which all modern physics rests are 

(GR) and 

(QFT). GR is a theoretical framework that only focuses on 

for understanding the universe in regions of both large-scale and 
high-mass: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. On the other 
hand, QFT is a theoretical framework that only focuses on three 
non-gravitational forces for understanding the universe in regions of 
both small scale and low mass: sub-atomic particles, atoms, molecules, 
etc. QFT successfully implemented the 

and unified the interactions (so-called 

) between the three non-gravitational forces: 

, 

, and 

force.

Through years of research, physicists have experimentally confirmed 
with tremendous accuracy virtually every prediction made by these two 
theories when in their appropriate domains of applicability. In 
accordance with their findings, scientists also learned that GR and QFT,
as they are currently formulated, are mutually incompatible -- they 
cannot both be right. Since the usual domains of applicability of GR and
QFT are so different, most situations require that only one of the two 
theories be used.

[\[][3]

As it turns out, this incompatibility between GR and QFT is only an 
apparent issue in regions of extremely small-scale and high-mass, such 
as those that exist within a black hole or during the beginning stages 
of the universe (i.e., the moment immediately following the 

).
To resolve this conflict, a theoretical framework revealing a deeper 
underlying reality, unifying gravity with the other three interactions, 
must be discovered to harmoniously integrate the realms of GR and QFT 
into a seamless whole: a single theory that, in principle, is capable of
describing all phenomena. In pursuit of this goal, 

has recently become an area of active research.

Over the past few decades, a single explanatory framework, called "[string theory][4]", has emerged that intends to be the ultimate theory of the universe. Some physicists believe that, at the [beginning of the universe][5] (up to 10−43
seconds after the Big Bang), the four fundamental forces were once a 
single fundamental force. According to string theory, every particle in 
the universe, at its most microscopic level ([Planck length][6]),
consists of varying combinations of vibrating strings (or strands) with
preferred patterns of vibration. String theory claims that it is 
through these specific oscillatory patterns of strings that a particle 
of unique mass and force charge is created (that is to say, the electron
is a type of string that vibrates one way, while the up-quark is a type
of string vibrating another way, and so forth).

Initially, the term _theory of everything_ was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a grandfather of [Ijon Tichy][7] --- a character from a cycle of [Stanisław Lem][8]'s [science fiction][9] stories of the 1960s --- was known to work on the "[General Theory of Everything][10]". Physicist [John Ellis][11]

[\[][12]

claims to have introduced the term into the technical literature in an article in 

in 1986\.

Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of 

research.

## Historical antecedents

### From ancient Greece to Einstein

[Archimedes][35]
was possibly the first scientist known to have described nature with 
axioms (or principles) and then deduce new results from them.

[\[][36]

He thus tried to describe "everything" starting from a few axioms. Any 
"theory of everything" is similarly expected to be based on axioms and 
to deduce all observable phenomena from them.

The concept of 'atom', introduced by [Democritus][37], unified all phenomena observed in nature as the motion of atoms. In [ancient Greek][38] times [philosophers][39]
speculated that the apparent diversity of observed phenomena was due to
a single type of interaction, namely the collisions of atoms. Following
[atomism][40], the [mechanical philosophy][41] of the 17th century posited that all forces could be ultimately reduced to [contact forces][42] between the atoms, then imagined as tiny solid particles.

[\[][43]

In the late 17th century, [Isaac Newton][44]'s
description of the long-distance force of gravity implied that not all 
forces in nature result from things coming into contact. Newton's work 
in his _[Principia][45]_ dealt with this in a further example of unification, in this case unifying [Galileo][46]'s work on terrestrial gravity, [Kepler][47]'s laws of planetary motion and the phenomenon of [tides][48] by explaining these apparent actions at a distance under one single law: the law of [universal gravitation][49].

[\[][50]

In 1814, building on these results, [Laplace][51] famously suggested that a [sufficiently powerful intellect][52]
could, if it knew the position and velocity of every particle at a 
given time, along with the laws of nature, calculate the position of any
particle at any other time:

[\[][53]

> An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set
> nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is 
> composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data 
> to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the 
> greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such 
> an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the 
> past would be present before its eyes._--- _Essai philosophique sur les probabilités_, Introduction. 1814_

Laplace thus envisaged a combination of gravitation and mechanics as a theory of everything. Modern [quantum mechanics][54] implies that [uncertainty is inescapable][55], and thus that Laplace's vision has to be amended: a theory of everything must include gravitation and quantum mechanics.

In 1820, [Hans Christian Ørsted][56] discovered a connection between electricity and magnetism, triggering decades of work that culminated in 1865, in [James Clerk Maxwell][57]'s theory of [electromagnetism][58]. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, it gradually became apparent that many common examples of forces -- contact forces, [elasticity][59], [viscosity][60], [friction][61], and [pressure][62] -- result from electrical interactions between the smallest particles of matter.

In his experiments of 1849--50, [Michael Faraday][63] was the first to search for a unification of [gravity][64] with electricity and magnetism.

[\[][65]

However, he found no connection.

In 1900, [David Hilbert][66] published a famous list of mathematical problems. In [Hilbert's sixth problem][67],
he challenged researchers to find an axiomatic basis to all of physics.
In this problem he thus asked for what today would be called a theory 
of everything.

[\[][68]

In the late 1920s, the new quantum mechanics showed that the [chemical bonds][69] between [atoms][70] were examples of (quantum) electrical forces, justifying [Dirac][71]'s
boast that "the underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical
theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus 
completely known".

[\[][72]

After 1915, when [Albert Einstein][73] published the theory of gravity ([general relativity][74]), the search for a [unified field theory][75]
combining gravity with electromagnetism began with a renewed interest. 
In Einstein's day, the strong and the weak forces had not yet been 
discovered, yet, he found the potential existence of two other distinct 
forces -gravity and electromagnetism- far more alluring. This launched 
his thirty-year voyage in search of the so-called "unified field theory"
that he hoped would show that these two forces are really 
manifestations of one grand underlying principle. During these last few 
decades of his life, this quixotic quest isolated Einstein from the 
mainstream of physics. Understandably, the mainstream was instead far 
more excited about the newly emerging framework of quantum mechanics. 
Einstein wrote to a friend in the early 1940s, "I have become a lonely 
old chap who is mainly known because he doesn't wear socks and who is 
exhibited as a curiosity on special occasions." Prominent contributors 
were [Gunnar Nordström][76], [Hermann Weyl][77], [Arthur Eddington][78], [Theodor Kaluza][79], [Oskar Klein][80],
and most notably, Albert Einstein and his collaborators. Einstein 
intensely searched for, but ultimately failed to find, a unifying 
theory.

[\[][81]

(But see:

.)
More than a half a century later, Einstein's dream of discovering a 
unified theory has become the Holy Grail of modern physics.

### Twentieth century and the nuclear interactions

In the twentieth century, the search for a unifying theory was interrupted by the discovery of the [strong][82] and [weak][83]
nuclear forces (or interactions), which differ both from gravity and 
from electromagnetism. A further hurdle was the acceptance that in a 
ToE, quantum mechanics had to be incorporated from the start, rather 
than emerging as a consequence of a deterministic unified theory, as 
Einstein had hoped.

Gravity and electromagnetism could always peacefully coexist as 
entries in a list of classical forces, but for many years it seemed that
gravity could not even be incorporated into the quantum framework, let 
alone unified with the other fundamental forces. For this reason, work 
on unification, for much of the twentieth century, focused on 
understanding the three "quantum" forces: electromagnetism and the weak 
and strong forces. The first two were [combined][84] in 1967--68 by [Sheldon Glashow][85], [Steven Weinberg][86], and [Abdus Salam][87] into the "electroweak" force.

[\[][88]

Electroweak unification is a 

: the electromagnetic and weak forces appear distinct at low energies because the particles carrying the weak force, the 

, have non-zero masses of 

80.4 GeV/

and 

91.2 GeV/

, whereas the 

, which carries the electromagnetic force, is massless. At higher energies Ws and Zs can be 

easily and the unified nature of the force becomes apparent.

While the strong and electroweak forces peacefully coexist in the [Standard Model][89]
of particle physics, they remain distinct. So far, the quest for a 
theory of everything is thus unsuccessful on two points: neither a 
unification of the strong and electroweak forces -- which Laplace would 
have called 'contact forces' -- has been achieved, nor has a unification 
of these forces with gravitation been achieved.

## Modern physics

### Conventional sequence of theories

A Theory of Everything would unify all the [fundamental interactions][90] of nature: [gravitation][91], [strong interaction][92], [weak interaction][93], and [electromagnetism][58]. Because the weak interaction can transform [elementary particles][94]
from one kind into another, the ToE should also yield a deep 
understanding of the various different kinds of possible particles. The 
usual assumed path of theories is given in the following graph, where 
each unification step leads one level up:

In this graph, electroweak unification occurs at around 100 GeV, grand unification is predicted to occur at 1016 GeV, and unification of the GUT force with gravity is expected at the [Planck energy][95], roughly 1019 GeV.

Several [Grand Unified Theories][96]
(GUTs) have been proposed to unify electromagnetism and the weak and 
strong forces. Grand unification would imply the existence of an 
electronuclear force; it is expected to set in at energies of the order 
of 1016 GeV, far greater than could be reached by any possible Earth-based [particle accelerator][97]. Although the simplest GUTs have been experimentally ruled out, the general idea, especially when linked with [supersymmetry][98],
remains a favorite candidate in the theoretical physics community. 
Supersymmetric GUTs seem plausible not only for their theoretical 
"beauty", but because they naturally produce large quantities of dark 
matter, and because the inflationary force may be related to GUT physics
(although it does not seem to form an inevitable part of the theory). 
Yet GUTs are clearly not the final answer; both the current standard 
model and all proposed GUTs are [quantum field theories][99] which require the problematic technique of [renormalization][100] to yield sensible answers. This is usually regarded as a sign that these are only [effective field theories][101], omitting crucial phenomena relevant only at very high energies.

[\[][3]

The final step in the graph requires resolving the separation between quantum mechanics and gravitation, often equated with [general relativity][74]. Numerous researchers concentrate their efforts on this specific step; nevertheless, no accepted theory of [quantum gravity][102] --
and thus no accepted theory of everything -- has emerged yet. It is 
usually assumed that the ToE will also solve the remaining problems of 
GUTs.

In addition to explaining the forces listed in the graph, a ToE may 
also explain the status of at least two candidate forces suggested by 
modern [cosmology][103]: an [inflationary force][104] and [dark energy][105]. Furthermore, cosmological experiments also suggest the existence of [dark matter][106],
supposedly composed of fundamental particles outside the scheme of the 
standard model. However, the existence of these forces and particles has
not been proven yet.

### String theory and M-theory

Since the 1990s, some physicists believe that 11-dimensional [M-theory][107], which is described in some limits by one of the five [perturbative][108][superstring theories][109], and in another by the maximally-[supersymmetric][98] 11-dimensional [supergravity][110], is the theory of everything. However, there is no widespread consensus on this issue.

A surprising property of [string][4]/[M-theory][107]
is that extra dimensions are required for the theory's consistency. In 
this regard, string theory can be seen as building on the insights of 
the [Kaluza--Klein theory][111],
in which it was realized that applying general relativity to a 
five-dimensional universe (with one of them small and curled up) looks 
from the four-dimensional perspective like the usual general relativity 
together with [Maxwell's electrodynamics][112]. This lent credence to the idea of unifying [gauge][113] and [gravity][64]
interactions, and to extra dimensions, but did not address the detailed
experimental requirements. Another important property of string theory 
is its [supersymmetry][98], which together with extra dimensions are the two main proposals for resolving the [hierarchy problem][114] of the [standard model][115],
which is (roughly) the question of why gravity is so much weaker than 
any other force. The extra-dimensional solution involves allowing 
gravity to propagate into the other dimensions while keeping other 
forces confined to a four-dimensional spacetime, an idea that has been 
realized with explicit stringy mechanisms.

[\[][116]

Research into string theory has been encouraged by a variety of 
theoretical and experimental factors. On the experimental side, the 
particle content of the standard model supplemented with [neutrino masses][117] fits into a spinor representation of [SO(10)][118], a subgroup of [E8][119] that routinely emerges in string theory, such as in [heterotic string theory][120]

[\[][121]

or (sometimes equivalently) in 

.

String theory has mechanisms that may explain why fermions come in three hierarchical generations, and explain the 

between quark generations.

On the theoretical side, it has begun to address some of the key questions in 

, such as resolving the 

, counting the correct 

and allowing for 

-changing processes.

It has also led to many insights in 

and in ordinary, strongly-coupled 

due to the 

.

In the late 1990s, it was noted that one major hurdle in this 
endeavor is that the number of possible four-dimensional universes is 
incredibly large. The small, "curled up" extra dimensions can be [compactified][122] in an enormous number of different ways (one estimate is 10500 ) each of which leads to different properties for the low-energy particles and forces. This array of models is known as the [string theory landscape][123].

[\[][124]

One proposed solution is that many or all of these possibilities are 
realised in one or another of a huge number of universes, but that only a
small number of them are habitable, and hence the fundamental constants
of the universe are ultimately the result of the [anthropic principle][125] rather than dictated by theory. This has led to criticism of string theory,

[\[][126]

arguing that it cannot make useful (i.e., original, falsifiable, and verifiable) predictions and regarding it as a 

. Others disagree,

and string theory remains an extremely active topic of investigation in 

.

### Loop quantum gravity

Current research on [loop quantum gravity][127] may eventually play a fundamental role in a ToE, but that is not its primary aim.

[\[][128]

Also loop quantum gravity introduces a lower bound on the possible length scales.

There have been recent claims that loop quantum gravity may be able to reproduce features resembling the [Standard Model][89]. So far only the first generation of [fermions][129] ([leptons][130] and [quarks][131]) with correct parity properties have been modelled by [Sundance Bilson-Thompson][132] using [preons][133] constituted of braids of spacetime as the building blocks.

[\[][134]

However, there is no derivation of the 

that would describe the interactions of such particles, nor is it 
possible to show that such particles are fermions, nor that the gauge 
groups or interactions of the Standard Model are realised. Utilization 
of 

concepts made it possible to demonstrate that the particles are able to survive 

.

This model leads to an interpretation of electric and colour charge 
as topological quantities (electric as number and chirality of twists 
carried on the individual ribbons and colour as variants of such 
twisting for fixed electric charge).

Bilson-Thompson's original paper suggested that the higher-generation
fermions could be represented by more complicated braidings, although 
explicit constructions of these structures were not given. The electric 
charge, colour, and parity properties of such fermions would arise in 
the same way as for the first generation. The model was expressly 
generalized for an infinite number of generations and for the weak force
bosons (but not for photons or gluons) in a 2008 paper by 
Bilson-Thompson, Hackett, Kauffman and Smolin.

[\[][135]

### Other attempts

A recent development is the theory of [causal fermion systems][136],

[\[][137]

giving all three current physical theories (

, 

and 

) as limiting cases.

A recent and very prolific attempt is called [Causal Sets][138].
As some of the approaches mentioned above, its direct goal isn't 
necessarily to achieve a ToE but primarily a working theory of quantum 
gravity, which might eventually include the standard model and become a 
candidate for a ToE. Its founding principle is that spacetime is 
fundamentally discrete and that the spacetime events are related by a [partial order][139]. This partial order has the physical meaning of the [causality relations][140] between relative [past and future distinguishing][141] spacetime events.

Outside the previously mentioned attempts there is [Garrett Lisi's E8 proposal][142].
This theory provides an attempt of identifying general relativity and 
the standard model within the Lie group E8\. The theory doesn't provide a
novel quantization procedure and the author suggests its quantization 
might follow the Loop Quantum Gravity approach above mentioned.

[\[][143]

Christoph Schiller's Strand Model attempts to account for the [gauge symmetry][113] of the [Standard Model][144] of particle physics, [U(1)][145]×[SU(2)][146]×[SU(3)][147], with the three [Reidemeister moves][148] of knot theory by equating each [elementary particle][149] to a different tangle of one, two, or three strands (selectively a long prime knot or unknotted curve, a [rational tangle][150], or a [braided][151] tangle respectively).

### Present status

At present, there is no candidate theory of everything that includes 
the standard model of particle physics and general relativity. For 
example, no candidate theory is able to calculate the fine structure 
constant or the mass of the electron. Most particle physicists expect 
that the outcome of the ongoing experiments -- the search for new 
particles at the large [particle accelerators][97] and for [dark matter][106] -- are needed in order to provide further input for a ToE.

## Theory of everything and philosophy

The philosophical implications of a physical ToE are frequently debated. For example, if philosophical [physicalism][152] is true, a physical ToE will coincide with a philosophical theory of everything.

The ["system building"][153] style of [metaphysics][154] attempts to answer _all_ the important questions in a coherent way, providing a complete picture of the world. [Plato][155] and [Aristotle][156]
could be said to have created early examples of comprehensive systems. 
In the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the 
system-building _scope_ of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist _method_ of philosophy, which is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure _[a priori][157]_ reason. Examples from the early modern period include the [Leibniz][158]'s [Monadology][159], [Descarte][160]'s [Dualism][161], and [Spinoza][162]'s [Monism][163]. [Hegel][164]'s [Absolute idealism][165] and [Whitehead][166]'s [Process philosophy][167] were later systems.

## Arguments against a theory of everything

In parallel to the intense search for a ToE, various scholars have seriously debated the possibility of its discovery.

### Gödel's incompleteness theorem

A number of scholars claim that [Gödel's incompleteness theorem][168]
suggests that any attempt to construct a ToE is bound to fail. Gödel's 
theorem, informally stated, asserts that any formal theory expressive 
enough for elementary arithmetical facts to be expressed and strong 
enough for them to be proved is either inconsistent (both a statement 
and its denial can be derived from its axioms) or incomplete, in the 
sense that there is a true statement that can't be derived in the formal
theory.

[Stanley Jaki][169], in his 1966 book _The Relevance of Physics_,
pointed out that, because any "theory of everything" will certainly be a
consistent non-trivial mathematical theory, it must be incomplete. He 
claims that this dooms searches for a deterministic theory of 
everything.

[\[][170]

In a later reflection, Jaki states that it is wrong to say that a final
theory is impossible, but rather that "when it is on hand one cannot 
know rigorously that it is a final theory."

[Freeman Dyson][171]
has stated that "Gödel's theorem implies that pure mathematics is 
inexhaustible. No matter how many problems we solve, there will always 
be other problems that cannot be solved within the existing rules. \[...\] 
Because of Gödel's theorem, physics is inexhaustible too. The laws of 
physics are a finite set of rules, and include the rules for doing 
mathematics, so that Gödel's theorem applies to them."

[\[][172]

[Stephen Hawking][173]
was originally a believer in the Theory of Everything but, after 
considering Gödel's Theorem, concluded that one was not obtainable: 
"Some people will be very disappointed if there is not an ultimate 
theory, that can be formulated as a finite number of principles. I used 
to belong to that camp, but I have changed my mind."

[\[][174]

[Jürgen Schmidhuber][175] (1997) has argued against this view; he points out that Gödel's theorems are irrelevant for [computable][176] physics.

[\[][177]

In 2000, Schmidhuber explicitly constructed limit-computable, deterministic universes whose 

based on 

, Gödel-like 

is extremely hard to detect but does not at all prevent formal ToEs describable by very few bits of information.

Related critique was offered by [Solomon Feferman][178],

[\[][179]

among others. Douglas S. Robertson offers 

as an example:

The underlying rules are simple and complete, but there are formally 
undecidable questions about the game's behaviors. Analogously, it may 
(or may not) be possible to completely state the underlying rules of 
physics with a finite number of well-defined laws, but there is little 
doubt that there are questions about the behavior of physical systems 
which are formally undecidable on the basis of those underlying laws.

Since most physicists would consider the statement of the underlying 
rules to suffice as the definition of a "theory of everything", most 
physicists argue that Gödel's Theorem does _not_ mean that a ToE 
cannot exist. On the other hand, the scholars invoking Gödel's Theorem 
appear, at least in some cases, to be referring not to the underlying 
rules, but to the understandability of the behavior of all physical 
systems, as when Hawking mentions arranging blocks into rectangles, 
turning the computation of [prime numbers][180] into a physical question.

[\[][181]

This definitional discrepancy may explain some of the disagreement among researchers.

### Fundamental limits in accuracy

No physical theory to date is believed to be precisely accurate. 
Instead, physics has proceeded by a series of "successive 
approximations" allowing more and more accurate predictions over a wider
and wider range of phenomena. Some physicists believe that it is 
therefore a mistake to confuse theoretical models with the true nature 
of reality, and hold that the series of approximations will never 
terminate in the "truth". Einstein himself expressed this view on 
occasions.

[\[][182]

Following this view, we may reasonably hope for 

theory of everything which self-consistently incorporates all currently
known forces, but we should not expect it to be the final answer.

On the other hand it is often claimed that, despite the apparently 
ever-increasing complexity of the mathematics of each new theory, in a 
deep sense associated with their underlying [gauge symmetry][183] and the number of [fundamental physical constants][184], the theories are becoming simpler. If this is the case, the process of simplification cannot continue indefinitely.

### Lack of fundamental laws

There is a philosophical debate within the physics community as to whether a theory of everything deserves to be called _the_ fundamental law of the universe.

[\[][185]

One view is the hard 

position that the ToE is the fundamental law and that all other 
theories that apply within the universe are a consequence of the ToE. 
Another view is that 

laws, which govern the behavior of 

, should be seen as equally fundamental. Examples of emergent laws are the 

and the theory of 

.
The advocates of emergence argue that emergent laws, especially those 
describing complex or living systems are independent of the low-level, 
microscopic laws. In this view, emergent laws are as fundamental as a 
ToE.

The debates do not make the point at issue clear. Possibly the only 
issue at stake is the right to apply the high-status term "fundamental" 
to the respective subjects of research. A well-known one took place 
between Steven Weinberg and [Philip Anderson][186]

### Impossibility of being "of everything"

Although the name "theory of everything" suggests the determinism of 
Laplace's quotation, this gives a very misleading impression. 
Determinism is frustrated by the probabilistic nature of quantum 
mechanical predictions, by the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions
that leads to [mathematical chaos][187],
by the limitations due to event horizons, and by the extreme 
mathematical difficulty of applying the theory. Thus, although the 
current standard model of particle physics "in principle" predicts 
almost all known non-gravitational phenomena, in practice only a few 
quantitative results have been derived from the full theory (e.g., the 
masses of some of the simplest [hadrons][188]),
and these results (especially the particle masses which are most 
relevant for low-energy physics) are less accurate than existing 
experimental measurements. The ToE would almost certainly be even harder
to apply for the prediction of experimental results, and thus might be 
of limited use.

A motive for seeking a ToE, apart from the pure intellectual 
satisfaction of completing a centuries-long quest, is that prior 
examples of unification have predicted new phenomena, some of which 
(e.g., [electrical generators][189])
have proved of great practical importance. And like in these prior 
examples of unification, the ToE would probably allow us to confidently 
define the domain of validity and residual error of low-energy 
approximations to the full theory.

### Infinite number of onion layers

[Lee Smolin][190] regularly argues that the layers of nature may be like the layers of an onion, and that the number of layers might be infinite. This would imply an infinite sequence of physical theories.

The argument is not universally accepted, because it is not obvious 
that infinity is a concept that applies to the foundations of nature.

### Impossibility of calculation

Weinberg

[\[][191]

points out that calculating the precise motion of an actual projectile 
in the Earth's atmosphere is impossible. So how can we know we have an 
adequate theory for describing the motion of projectiles? Weinberg 
suggests that we know 

(Newton's laws of motion and 
gravitation) that work "well enough" for simple examples, like the 
motion of planets in empty space. These principles have worked so well 
on simple examples that we can be reasonably confident they will work 
for more complex examples. For example, although 

includes equations that do not have exact solutions, it is widely 
accepted as a valid theory because all of its equations with exact 
solutions have been experimentally verified. Likewise, a ToE must work 
for a wide range of simple examples in such a way that we can be 
reasonably confident it will work for every situation in physics.
