            <title><![CDATA[About me]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About me</h1><p>The world according to the Spirit.It took me at least 30 years of my life to search for answers to my questions. Writing a book forces you to be logically consistent and to explain your train of thought and development of ideas fittingly. To write a chapter of an elaborate book like this requires an enormous mental concentration and peace of mind as well as the command of a good deal of background knowledge. I have followed scientific news and have read many books to take my knowledge to a higher level. I am a generalist and an autodidact, who has been inspired by the ideas of the Enlightenment. The era of enlightenment gave us freedom and equality of citizens and the Trias Politica, being the separation of legislative, executive and judiciary powers, as well as the separation of church and state. The era of enlightenment gave us Uomo Universalis and the possibility to increase knowledge and skills through empiricism and spiritual and intellectual enrichment.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/98a686f2069e9b6a72cce02e1465d185e8dd5fb6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The period before, during and after the Big Bang. There was evolution even before the Big Bang by the Spirit.The Spirit is a cocoon to organize matter versus anti-matter and the Big Bang. The Spirit is the leading motor for evolution of nature constants, values of nature laws plus evolution of matter, live and spiritual conscious. A total new concept for (meta) physics.</p>]]></description>
